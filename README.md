# What is `.trunk`?

Trunk Check uses `.trunk` to find issues in your repositories and pull requests. Learn more
[here][check-github-integration-docs].

Your `.trunk` repository should always be created by generating it from the
[`trunk-io/.trunk-template-docs`](https://github.com/trunk-io/.trunk-template-docs) repository.
