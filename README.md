# What is `.trunk`?

Trunk Check uses `.trunk` to find issues in your repositories and pull requests. Learn more about the [`trunk-io/.trunk`](https://github.com/trunk-io/.trunk) integration with GitHub Actions [here](https://docs.trunk.io/check/github-integration).
[here][check-github-integration].

Your `.trunk` repository should always be created by generating it from the
[`trunk-io/.trunk-template`](https://github.com/trunk-io/.trunk-template) repository.
