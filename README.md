# What is `.trunk`?

Trunk Check uses `.trunk` to find issues in your repositories and pull requests. Learn more
[here][check-github-integration].

Your `.trunk` repository should always be created by generating it from the
[`trunk-io/.trunk-template`](https://github.com/trunk-io/.trunk-template) repository and follow the instructions to generate your `.trunk` repository.
