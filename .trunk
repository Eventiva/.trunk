class TrunkFile:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def store_issue(self, issue):
        # Store the issue information in the ".trunk" file
        with open(self.file_path, "a") as file:
            file.write(issue + "\n")

    def get_issues(self):
        # Retrieve the stored issue information from the ".trunk" file
        with open(self.file_path, "r") as file:
            issues = file.readlines()
        return [issue.strip() for issue in issues]
```

The `TrunkFile` class represents the ".trunk" file. It has two methods:
- `store_issue`: This method takes an `issue` as input and appends it to the ".trunk" file.
- `get_issues`: This method reads the ".trunk" file and returns a list of stored issues.

We will also need to update the necessary imports and variables in the existing codebase to use the `TrunkFile` class.

For example, if there is a file named `main.py` that needs to interact with the ".trunk" file, we would update it as follows:

```python
from .trunk import TrunkFile

trunk_file = TrunkFile(".trunk")

# Store an issue
trunk_file.store_issue("Issue 1")

# Retrieve all stored issues
issues = trunk_file.get_issues()
print(issues)
