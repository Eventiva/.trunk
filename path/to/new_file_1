def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the two numbers.

This file contains a single function named `calculate_sum` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

To integrate this file into the existing codebase, you can import it in any module or file where you need to perform addition operations. For example:

```python
# File: some_module.py

from path.to.new_file_1 import calculate_sum

result = calculate_sum(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

Make sure to update the import statement and file path according to your project's directory structure.

For testing purposes, you can write unit tests for the `calculate_sum` function. Here's an example of a test case using the `unittest` framework:

```python
import unittest
from path.to.new_file_1 import calculate_sum

class TestCalculateSum(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sum(self):
        result = calculate_sum(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_negative_numbers(self):
        result = calculate_sum(-5, -10)
        self.assertEqual(result, -15)

    def test_zero(self):
        result = calculate_sum(0, 0)
        self.assertEqual(result, 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
